Patient Management System (PMS)
Project Overview
Patient Management System (PMS) is a desktop healthcare application developed in C++ using SFML. The system demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and modular software design, handling real-world healthcare tasks such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor management, report handling, and payment processing.
This project showcases practical problem-solving, file-based data persistence, GUI integration, and input validation in a professional, maintainable codebase.
Key Features
Patient Management – First-time visitor verification, registration, and profile retrieval
Appointment Scheduling – Book and manage appointments with doctors
Doctor Management – View doctor specialties, schedules, and assistants
Report Handling – Save, retrieve, and display medical reports
Payment Processing – Record payments and generate receipts
Graphical Interface – Visual display of patient info, hospital imagery, and confirmation screens using SFML
Data Persistence – All data stored securely in binary files (.dat)
Input Validation & Error Handling – Ensures accuracy and robustness
 Technologies & Skills
Programming Languages: C++
GUI Framework: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
Concepts Applied: OOP (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Modular Design)
Tools & Techniques: File Handling, Validation, Error Handling, Class Architecture
 System Architecture
The project uses a class-based modular design:
Person → base class for patients and staff
Verification → patient verification and input
Patient → patient workflow management
DoctorDetails, Nurse, PersonalAssistant → manage staff and schedules
Report, Reason, Amount, DateTime → handle records, visit reasons, payments, and appointments
How to Run
Install SFML and set up in Visual Studio.
Build the project.
Run the executable to start the system.
All SFML libraries should be linked correctly in the IDE.
